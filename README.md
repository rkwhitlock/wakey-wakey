Our project, Wakey-Wakey, is a smart alarm system that uses active engagement to ensure users wake up on time, reducing stress and improving productivity. Unlike traditional alarms, our system incorporates wakefulness-promoting strategies such as standing up, moving, and solving sudoku puzzles to prevent oversleeping and setting users up for a more motivated day.

- LCD displays the time provided by the connected Real Time Clock
- At set time Alarm goes off connecting to bluetooth speaker and playing wake up audio and turns stepper motor to open the blinds
- Audio keeps playing until user gets out of bed and puts their hands above their head for the camera
- Camera verifies with Computer Vision and will prompt a short sudoku puzzle on the monitor
- Puzzle is solved using joystick and keypad and if it is not completed in 2 minutes the speaker will play the wake-up audio again
